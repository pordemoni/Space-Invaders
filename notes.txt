   > Fix firing mode cycling
   ? The firing mode determines the Projectile type
      ? issue: the spawned Projectiles only checks the firing mode upon key (spacebar) press, hence
      ? on continuous firing (holding down of the spacebar), the Projectile type doesn't change until
      ? the spacebar has been released and pressed again
      
      * Possible solutions:
      - change the implementation of spawn_projectile()

      ! turn the fire() methods from setInterval() based functions into frameCount based functions
      - player smoke/fire trail
      - Projectile collision effects
